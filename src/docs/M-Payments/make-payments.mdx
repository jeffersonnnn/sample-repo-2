## Funds Transfer Plugin

The Remita Funds Transfer Plugin is an all-inclusive tool that offers the option to directly transmit payments off of your transactional database(s) to designated beneficiaries across all banks. You get started by installing the client locally on your environment and configuring it to interact with your database to send payments to Remita for processing. You can download the plugin installation files here.



## Standing Order

You can make recurrent payments to your billers, vendors, family members and friends at regular intervals by setting up a standing order mandate with this API. When you activate the mandate, Remita automatically debits your account and credits the specified beneficiary across any bank at the intervals you have indicated.
