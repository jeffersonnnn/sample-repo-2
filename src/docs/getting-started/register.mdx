## Go Live

Specify a billing account to complete your go live request (See Img. 3) and you will be migrated to production once your checklist compliance is verified.

Once your implementation is complete in line with the UAT Checklist you can logon to your profile and click the "Request to Go Live" button to obtain approval for migrating your implementation to production.

We’ll review to confirm checklist compliance and, if everything is in order, approve your request so you can immediately start receiving payments!
