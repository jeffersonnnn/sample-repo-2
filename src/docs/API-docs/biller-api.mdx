title: Biller API

## Overview
Integrating to Remita for Biller payments enables your customers make payments to billers on Remita through your platform. This provides you with the capability to offer your customers access to the vast array of billers and merchants, including schools, churches, service providers and the Federal Government ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) available on Remita to purchase and subscribe to their various products and services.

The process involves your customers selecting a biller to pay via your platform. They will supply payment details and confirm the details so you can debit their account with AmountDue to credit a designated Funds Holding Account. Your customers will be emailed Remita receipts (which are FGN MDA-recognized for TSA-bound payments) for each transaction.
