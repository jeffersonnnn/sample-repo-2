## Remita Inline

The Remita Inline Checkout is our iframe checkout option which displays a secure payment form(See bash console below) as an overlay on your checkout page. This makes it ideal for use with shopping cart applications or your own custom checkout process. You can use the code snippet below and download the js file here.



### Example:

```js lineNumbers=true
<form >
 <script src="http://www.remitademo.net/payment/v1/remita-pay-inline.bundle.js"></script>
  <button type="button" onclick="makePayment()"> Pay </button>
		</form>
			  <script>
				function makePayment() {
